ModView
=======

Raven Software's ModView version 2.1, for Jedi Outcast & Jedi Academy. This code has been modified, and is NOT the original source code.


## Changes:

* Floor is now gray, with the default height now -24.
* Fixed 'off' in .skin files not hiding surfaces (fix by Xycaleth from modview qt).
* Disabled toolbar docking.
* Compiles with VS 2022.
* Fixed a few warnings.
* Minor UI cleanup.
