ModView
=======

Raven Software's ModView version 2.1, for Jedi Outcast & Jedi Academy. This code has been modified, and is NOT the original source code.


## Changes:

* MD3 support.
* Floor is now gray, with the default height matching player models.
* Fixed 'off' in .skin files not hiding surfaces (fix by xycaleth from modview qt).
* Disabled toolbar docking, so users cannot move it accidently or otherwise.
* Compiles with VS 2015.
* Fixed a few warnings.
* Minor UI cleanup.
